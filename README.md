# ReconstructGenomeSequence
Reconstructed the original genome from a set of shotgun reads of the genome using Hamiltonian path approach to maximize the weight of the Hamiltonian Path. Also did the same using Eulerian path approach which is more efficient as finding a hamiltonian path in a graph is an NP-complete problem
